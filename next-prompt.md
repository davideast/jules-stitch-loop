**Page Structure:**
1. **Existing Leaderboard:** The current leaderboard table.
2. **New "Hot Streak" Column:** A new column added to the table titled "STREAK".
3. **Badge:** A badge in the new column for each row, visualizing the developer's shipping streak. The badge should be a flame icon with the number of consecutive days next to it.
