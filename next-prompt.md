page: feed
---
Create a `feed.html` page that shows a real-time stream of incoming commits. The design should be consistent with the existing dark, terminal-inspired theme.

The page should contain:
1.  **Header:** A main heading, e.g., "Live Activity Feed".
2.  **Commit Stream:** A list of recent commits, showing the developer's avatar, name, commit message, and time.
3.  **Real-time Updates:** The feed should give the impression of being updated in real-time.
