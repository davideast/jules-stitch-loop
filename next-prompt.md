page: profile
---
A user profile page that continues the dark, terminal-inspired aesthetic of the leaderboard. The header should be consistent with the main page, featuring the "jules.top" logo, a search bar, and a "Live Feed" link.

The main content area should be divided into three sections:

1.  **User Header:** Display a large circular avatar of the user. Next to it, show their username in a bold, sans-serif font. Include a "Hot Streak" badge, perhaps with a flame icon and the number of consecutive days shipping, highlighted in an electric yellow. Below the username, include a sparkline graph visualizing their commit activity over the last 30 days.

2.  **Key Statistics:** A grid of key metrics with large, monospaced numbers. Include "Total Commits," "PRs Merged," and "Lines Shipped." Use the "Git Commit Green" color for the numbers to indicate positive activity.

3.  **Top Repositories:** A clean, bordered table listing the user's most active repositories. The table should have two columns: "Repository" (showing the repo name, e.g., "jules-ai/jules-stitch-loop") and "Commits" (showing the user's commit count for that repo).
