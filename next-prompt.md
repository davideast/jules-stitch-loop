page: feed

Create a real-time activity feed page that aligns with the dark, terminal-inspired aesthetic. The header should remain consistent with the other pages, showing the "jules.top" logo, a search bar, and navigation links.

The main content area should be a single, continuously updating column of events. Each event item should include:

1.  **Avatar & User:** A small circular user avatar next to their username. The username should be a clickable link to their profile page.
2.  **Action Description:** A concise text description of the action, e.g., "Merged PR #1234 in `jules-ai/jules`". Use "Git Commit Green" for commit-related actions and "Merged Purple" for pull requests.
3.  **Repository Link:** The repository name should be a clickable link.
4.  **Timestamp:** A relative timestamp (e.g., "3 seconds ago") on the right-hand side of the event item.

The feed should feel dynamic and live, with a subtle glow or animation for new items appearing at the top.
