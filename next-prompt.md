page: profile
---
Create a `profile.html` page that displays the activity of a single developer. The design should be consistent with the existing dark, terminal-inspired theme.

The page should contain:
1.  **Header:** A main heading with the developer's name, e.g., "Jules's Profile".
2.  **User Avatar:** Display the developer's avatar.
3.  **Stats:** Show key statistics like "Total Ships", "Commits", and "Merged PRs".
4.  **Activity Feed:** A list or table of recent commits and merged PRs.
5.  **Repositories:** A section showcasing the top repositories the developer has contributed to.
