Create an `about.html` page that explains how `jules.top` works. The design should be consistent with the existing dark, terminal-inspired theme.

The page should contain:
1.  **Header:** A main heading like "How It Works" or "The Protocol".
2.  **Core Concept:** A short, engaging paragraph explaining that `jules.top` tracks developer activity via Git commits and Pull Requests made with the Jules agent.
3.  **Data Source:** A section explaining that the data is sourced directly from GitHub events, ensuring transparency and accuracy. Use a code block style for this section.
4.  **Scoring:** A brief explanation of how "Total Ships" are calculated. Keep it simple, e.g., "1 Ship = 1 Commit or 1 Merged PR".
5.  **Fair Play:** A note about data integrity and how the system prevents gaming the leaderboard.
6.  **Call to Action:** A link to the official Jules GitHub repository for users who want to learn more or contribute.
