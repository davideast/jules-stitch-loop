A friendly, competitive, data-dense leaderboard dashboard for tracking developers who ship the most code with the Jules background coding agent. Dark mode with a terminal/hacker aesthetic. GitHub-inspired color scheme: near-black background (#0d1117), bright white text for usernames and scores.

The main content is a dense table showing: Rank (with gold/silver/bronze badges for top 3), Avatar circle, Username, Total Ships count, and Last Active timestamp. Monospaced font for all numbers and data. Bold sans-serif for names and ranks.

Accent colors: "Git Commit Green" (#238636) for positive metrics. Electric yellow (#f0c800) highlighting the #1 ranked user row.

Header contains the logo "jules.top" aligned left, a search input field, and a "Live Feed" link. Footer shows "Built with Jules" and a GitHub icon link.

Minimalist design. Thin 1px borders on table rows. High contrast. No hero images. Data is the hero.
