Public roadmap of upcoming features for jules.top. A Kanban-style board tracking the future of the platform.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: Web, Desktop-first
- Theme: Dark, minimal, data-focused
- Background: Deep charcoal/near-black (#0f1419 or similar GitHub dark)
- Surface: Slightly lighter dark for cards/rows (subtle contrast)
- Primary Accent: Teal/Cyan (#2dd4bf) for active states, pagination, icons
- Trophy Colors: Gold 🥇, Silver 🥈, Bronze 🥉 emoji for top 3 ranks
- Text Primary: White (#ffffff) for names, ranks, important data
- Text Secondary: Muted gray (#6b7280) for column headers, timestamps
- Text Numbers: White, monospaced font for scores (e.g., "8,421")
- Font: Clean sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or system default)
- Avatars: Circular, ~40px, with subtle border
- Table: No visible row borders, generous vertical padding (~20px per row)
- Columns: RANK | DEVELOPER (avatar + name) | TOTAL SHIPS | LAST ACTIVE
- Pagination: Circular active page indicator (teal), numbered pages
- Layout: Centered content, max-width container, ample whitespace
- No decorative elements, no gradients, no shadows - pure data focus

**Page Structure:**
1. Header: "Roadmap" with global navigation.
2. Layout: Three distinct columns (Planned, In Progress, Shipped).
3. Cards: Feature requests/ideas in each column.

**Specific Elements:**
- Status Indicators: "In Progress" (Pulsing Yellow/Orange), "Planned" (Gray/Blue), "Shipped" (Green).
- Feature Cards: Minimal dark cards with title, short description, and "Upvote" count (e.g. "▲ 42").
- Progress Bars: Overall completion percentage for the current quarter.
